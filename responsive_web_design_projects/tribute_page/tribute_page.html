            <h2>Here are a few highlights of his life</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Born December 14, 1980 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States</li>
                <li>On April 19th, 1995 an event altered the course of his life. While in a science class at around 9:02AM, a terrorist detonated a truck filled with fertilizer and killed 168 people, including 19 little babies that were in a nursery on the ground floor of a building in downtown Oklahoma City.</li>
                <li>One day when he was a sophomore in high school, after getting tired of fights with his strict dad, he grabbed all his stuff and threw it in a 1986 white Ford Taurus sedan he had inherited from his grandmother who had passed away and just drove off leaving his home</li>
                <li>He spent the next year of his life just living in the car, staying in Walmart parking lots overnight where there was light</li>
                <li>He dropped out of high school after seeing a man from his church who had been a huge inspiration to him and who had a college degree but had been reduced to serving food in cafeteria with a hairnet on and he just kind of became disillusioned with school</li>
                <li>Life as a homeless high school dropout was hard and he got a job at Taco Bell to make ends meet and survive.</li>
                <li>He figured out he needed to go back to school if he wanted a future so he took the GED and enrolled in the cheapest state university he could. He also traded the Taco Bell job for working at different newspapers around town while he was studying liberal arts</li>
                <li>After graduating, he moved to China via an international graduate program</li>
                <li>After 4 years of studying and working as a teacher in China, together with his wife (a classmate of hers), they moved back to Oklahoma City.</li>
                <li>At 26 he was the youngest school director in the school system in a school teaching expats how to speak English</li>
                <li>After running schools for a few years in the U.S. and China, he was in a situation where he noticed that his teachers were spending a whole lot of time chained to their desks doing manual tasks and so he googled around and learned some tools to help automate this processes which led to the teachers having more time to be free and teach</li>
                <li> He spent nine months just going to hackathons, hanging out at hackerspaces and coding and doing everything he could - working through tons of textbooks, working through free online courses that were coming out of MIT and Stanford, and just every weekend, a different hackathon and was able to get an entry-level developer job</li>
                <li>While working as a developer, he founded freeCodeCamp which was launched in October 2014 and incorporated as Free Code Camp, Inc- a non-profit organization that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, online publications and local organizations that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone</li>
